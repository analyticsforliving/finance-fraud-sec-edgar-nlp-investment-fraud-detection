exchange rate on the second Business Day preceding such Interest Payment Date or the second Business Day preceding the maturity of an installment of principal, as the case may be, or if no rate is quoted for euros, the last date such rate is quoted.
Any payment in respect of Securities so made in U.S. Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default. Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent will be responsible for obtaining exchange or foreign currency rates, effecting conversions or otherwise

the second Business Day preceding such Interest Payment Date or the second Business Day preceding the maturity of an installment of principal, as the case may be, or if no rate is quoted for euros, the last date such rate is quoted. Any payment in
