BAC,BAC,0.5209626034421041,1,,"2 From Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick: “We believe our second quarter results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and help demonstrate that we are well-positioned to support the broader economy. Asset quality remained strong, with net charge-offs at $1.5 billion for the sixth consecutive quarter. Consumer delinquencies have been stabilizing, while card net charge-offs improved year-over-year and commercial nonperforming loans declined sequentially. In addition, we delivered strong loan and deposit growth and maintained our disciplined pricing.” Bank of America Financial Highlights ($ in billions, except per share data) 2Q25 1Q25 2Q24 Total revenue, net of interest expense $26.5 $27.4 $25.4 Provision for credit losses 1.6 1.5 1.5 Noninterest expense 17.2 17.8 16.3 Pretax income 7.7 8.1 7.6 Pretax, pre-provision income1(F) 9.3 9.6 9.1 Income tax expense 0.6 0.7 0.7 Net income 7.1 7.4 6.9 Diluted earnings per share $0.89 $0.90 $0.83 1 Pretax, pre-provision income represents a non-GAAP financial measure.
